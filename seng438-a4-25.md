# Introduction

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites (Josh)

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing (Josh)

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process (Josh)

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints (Josh)

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

Selenium and Sikulix each serve the same purpose in automation testing, but offer unique benefits and face specific challenges. Selenium works great when it comes to testing web applications across various browsers, such as Chrome and Firefox, and is compatible with frameworks like TestNG, JUnit, and NUnit. This simplifies test management and allows for a high degree of customization at no cost. Selenium is mainly geared towards web environments, leaving desktop applications a bit out of its reach. Furthermore, its reliance on programming know-how might sideline testers who aren't as code-savvy, and occasionally, its tests may stumble without clear ties to the actual application issues.

Sikulix differs from Selenium in that it has image recognition, enabling testers to interact with user interfaces without needing the source code. This makes Sikulix a preffered tool for desktop automation across different operating systems like Windows, Mac, and Linux, offering a gentler learning curve for those less familiar with coding. However, Sikulix's focus on visual elements does mean it's not the best fit for web automation tasks. Its performance can lag with larger or more complex setups, and significant UI changes might throw it off course.

In summary, Selenium is great for web automation and if you're comfortable with coding. Offering extensive browser support and integration with popular testing frameworks. Sikulix is great for desktop automation and prefer a less code-intensive tool for its image-based approach. The decision between Selenium and Sikulix depends on your project's needs, the environment (web or desktop), and your comfort level with programming.

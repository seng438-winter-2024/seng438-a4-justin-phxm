For the Range class, we can see that the Mutation coverage increased from 67% to 77%, a 10% increase due to the new Mutants added to the test suite.

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

Selenium and Sikulix each serve the same purpose in automation testing, but offer unique benefits and face specific challenges. Selenium works great when it comes to testing web applications across various browsers, such as Chrome and Firefox, and is compatible with frameworks like TestNG, JUnit, and NUnit. This simplifies test management and allows for a high degree of customization at no cost. Selenium is mainly geared towards web environments, leaving desktop applications a bit out of its reach. Furthermore, its reliance on programming know-how might sideline testers who aren't as code-savvy, and occasionally, its tests may stumble without clear ties to the actual application issues.

Sikulix differs from Selenium in that it has image recognition, enabling testers to interact with user interfaces without needing the source code. This makes Sikulix a preffered tool for desktop automation across different operating systems like Windows, Mac, and Linux, offering a gentler learning curve for those less familiar with coding. However, Sikulix's focus on visual elements does mean it's not the best fit for web automation tasks. Its performance can lag with larger or more complex setups, and significant UI changes might throw it off course.

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Justin and Joshua worked on increasing mutation coverage for the Range class and GUI tests for ebay adding to cart, buy it now, search functionality.

Arvii and Varshiny worked on increasing mutation coverage for the Data Utilities class and GUI tests for ebay login, feedback, and signup section.

Each group worked on analysis of 5 mutants for Range class for a total of 10 mutant analyses.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

A huge hurdle that we had in this lab was from the mutation testing. The hurdle came from running the mutation tests where we waited very long for the mutation tests to run. Some group members had to wait up to 15 minutes for the mutation tests to finish and some group members only had to wait around 2 minutes. We thought this may have had to do with the operating system environment since the MacOS users had to wait longer and Windows users wait time was short. In addition, we also found the IDE setup very difficult. The instructions on how to setup and run PITEST were very unclear and we spent hours of trying to figure out how to run the mutation tests. In the end, we solved the issue by placing all the necessary files into a single package and the mutations ran fine.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab was an excellent opportunity to explore Mutation testing and GUI testing. The lab could have been further improved if the instructions to setup the mutation tests were more clear.
